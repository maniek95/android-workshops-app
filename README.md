<!-- 
    Couple of points about editing:
    
    1. Keep it SIMPLE.
    2. Refer to reference docs and other external sources when possible.
    3. Remember that the file must be useful for new / external developers, and stand as a documentation basis on its own.
    4. Try to make it as informative as possible.
    5. Do not put data that can be easily found in code.
    6. Include this file on ALL branches.
